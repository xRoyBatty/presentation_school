Number of images: 1
CSS rules affecting image size:
1. .slide (parent container, lines 28-39)
   - width: 100%
   - height: 100%
   - position: absolute

2. .fullscreen-image (lines 367-374)
   - position: absolute
   - top: 0
   - left: 0
   - width: 100%
   - height: 100%
   - object-fit: cover

3. Inline styles on <img> element (line 1624)
   - filter: brightness(1.1) saturate(1.2) [filtering only, not sizing]

IMAGE SIZING BEHAVIOR:
- The single <img> tag with class "fullscreen-image" fills the entire viewport (100% width and height)
- object-fit: cover ensures the image covers the entire area while maintaining aspect ratio
- The image is positioned absolutely at top: 0, left: 0, covering the full 100vw × 100vh slide
- No max-width, flex properties, or percentage-based sizing constraints beyond 100%
